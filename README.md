# GDInfo
Geometry Dash swiss knife

## But what can it do?
1. check full info about a level
2. check full info about an account (including unique Player ID)
3. export to JSON
4. download user's icons to PNG

## 1.99 is out!
- Now uses only English language
- Colors!
- Better code
- Now do all the dirty tasks in separate modules, main script only needs to display the info from modules
- A lot more... 
#### Why 1.99?
Because update 2.0 will FINALLY add comments, posts, likes and other missing functionality. 1.99 only has visual changes.

## Bugs
Wow, you found it? Issues tab is for you!

## Under the hood
GDInfo is using GDBrowser.com's API

## TO-DO
1. Implement lists (posts, comments, search) and additional input (to make actions more structured)
